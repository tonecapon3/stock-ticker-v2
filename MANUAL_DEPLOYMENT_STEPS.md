# Manual Deployment Steps for Staging Instance

Since the automated script requires GitHub tokens, let's create the staging instance manually through the AWS Console. This is actually simpler and more reliable.

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Manual Deployment

### Step 1: Create New Amplify App via AWS Console

1. **Open AWS Amplify Console**: 
   - Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
   - Make sure you're in the `us-east-1` region (same as your main instance)

2. **Click "Create new app"**

3. **Connect to GitHub**:
   - Choose "GitHub" as the source
   - Click "Connect branch"
   - Authorize AWS Amplify to access your GitHub account if prompted
   - Select repository: `tonecapon3/stock-ticker-v2`
   - Select branch: `staging` ‚úÖ (this is key for session isolation)
   - Click "Next"

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings

1. **App Name**: `stock-ticker-staging`

2. **Build and test settings**:
   - Amplify will auto-detect your `amplify.yml` file
   - The staging branch configuration will be used automatically
   - Click "Next"

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

In the "Environment variables" section, add these **session isolation variables**:

```
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = pk_test_d29ya2FibGUtbWFydGluLTAuY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = pk_test_d29ya2FibGUtbWFydGluLTAuY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA
CLERK_SECRET_KEY = sk_test_SThTzDsbXHbUr9wjn1srdFmnMXTrkeAxCu5gOif5uW
VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://stock-ticker-v2.onrender.com
VITE_INSTANCE_ID = staging
VITE_SESSION_DOMAIN = staging  
VITE_DEBUG_MODE = true
VITE_LOG_LEVEL = debug
VITE_ENFORCE_HTTPS = true
VITE_ENABLE_HSTS = true
VITE_ENABLE_CSP = true
NODE_ENV = production
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: The `VITE_INSTANCE_ID` and `VITE_SESSION_DOMAIN` variables are what ensure session isolation!

### Step 4: Review and Deploy

1. **Review all settings**
2. Click "Save and deploy"
3. **Wait for the build** (usually 3-5 minutes)

### Step 5: Get Your New URLs

Once deployed, you'll have:
- **Staging URL**: `https://staging.[NEW_APP_ID].amplifyapp.com`
- **App ID**: Will be shown in the Amplify Console

## üîç What to Expect

### Current Setup:
- **Production**: https://main.d7lc7dqjkvbj3.amplifyapp.com (VITE_INSTANCE_ID=production)
- **Staging**: https://staging.[NEW_APP_ID].amplifyapp.com (VITE_INSTANCE_ID=staging)

### Session Isolation Test:
1. Open both URLs in separate browser tabs
2. Sign in to production ‚Üí Check staging (should be signed out)
3. Sign in to staging ‚Üí Both can be authenticated simultaneously
4. Sign out of one ‚Üí Other remains signed in

## üõ†Ô∏è Alternative: Quick AWS CLI Method

If you want to try CLI again with a simpler approach:

```bash
# Create the app (without GitHub token complications)
aws amplify create-app \
  --name "stock-ticker-staging" \
  --description "Staging instance with session isolation"

# Note the App ID from the output, then:
# 1. Go to AWS Console to connect the GitHub repository
# 2. Add environment variables manually
# 3. Deploy the staging branch
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

- ‚úÖ New Amplify app created with staging branch
- ‚úÖ Environment variables set (especially VITE_INSTANCE_ID=staging)  
- ‚úÖ Build completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Staging URL is accessible
- ‚úÖ Session isolation works (test with both URLs)
- ‚úÖ Same Clerk authentication but separate sessions
- ‚úÖ Same backend API connectivity

## üìû Support

If you run into issues:
1. **Check build logs** in Amplify Console
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Test the production instance** first to ensure it still works
4. **Check GitHub branch** is `staging` (not main)

The manual method through AWS Console is actually the most reliable approach for this setup!
