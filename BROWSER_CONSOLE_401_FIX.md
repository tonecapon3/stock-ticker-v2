# Browser Console 401 Error Resolution

## Issue Description
The browser console was showing 401 Unauthorized errors when trying to fetch data from the API server:

```
GET https://stock-ticker-v2.onrender.com/api/remote/stocks 401 (Unauthorized)
GET https://stock-ticker-v2.onrender.com/api/remote/controls 401 (Unauthorized)
📡 API Response status: 401
⚠️ API server not available, using local stock data
```

## Root Cause
The client application was making API calls to protected endpoints **without including authentication headers**. While the JWT bridge authentication system was set up correctly, the actual fetch requests were not using the authentication tokens.

### Specific Issues Found:

1. **Missing Authentication Headers**: API fetch calls in `src/lib/context.tsx` were sending only `Content-Type` headers, but no `Authorization` header with the Bearer token.

2. **Not Waiting for JWT Bridge**: The API sync was starting immediately without waiting for the JWT bridge authentication to complete.

3. **Incorrect Timing**: The application was trying to make authenticated API calls before the JWT bridge had established authentication with the server.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Added Authentication Headers to API Calls

**File**: `src/lib/context.tsx`

**Before**:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});
```

**After**:
```javascript
const headers = getJWTAuthHeaders();
const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: headers,
});
```

This change was applied to both:
- `fetchStocksFromAPI()` function (line 819)
- `fetchControlsFromAPI()` function (line 970)

### 2. Updated API Sync to Wait for JWT Bridge

**File**: `src/lib/context.tsx`

**Before**: API sync started immediately without checking authentication status

**After**: Added proper authentication flow:
```javascript
// Wait for JWT bridge to be ready if API server is configured
if (shouldUseApiServer() && !isReadyForAPI) {
  if (isBridging) {
    console.log('⏳ Waiting for JWT bridge authentication to complete...');
    return;
  }
  if (bridgeError) {
    console.error('❌ JWT bridge error:', bridgeError);
    console.warn('💡 Application will run in local-only mode due to auth error');
    return;
  }
  return;
}
```

### 3. Updated Dependencies

Added JWT bridge status to the useEffect dependencies:
```javascript
}, [fetchStocksFromAPI, fetchControlsFromAPI, isBridging, isBridged, isReadyForAPI, bridgeError]);
```

## Authentication Flow

### How the JWT Bridge Works:

1. **User Signs In**: User authenticates with Clerk
2. **JWT Bridge Triggered**: `useClerkJWTBridge` hook detects Clerk authentication
3. **Server Authentication**: Bridge automatically logs into JWT server with pre-configured credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `AdminSecure2025!@`
4. **Token Storage**: JWT token from server is stored in tokenStorage
5. **API Calls**: Subsequent API calls include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

### Authentication Headers Function:

```javascript
function getJWTAuthHeaders(): Record<string, string> {
  const headers: Record<string, string> = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  };
  
  // Check if we have JWT bridge authentication (for Clerk users)
  if (isJWTBridgeAuthenticated()) {
    return getJWTBridgeHeaders();
  }
  
  // Fallback to direct JWT token storage
  const token = tokenStorage.getJWTToken();
  const sessionId = localStorage.getItem('jwt_session_id');
  
  if (token) {
    headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  
  if (sessionId) {
    headers['X-Session-ID'] = sessionId;
  }
  
  return headers;
}
```

## Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED

### Expected Browser Console Output (After Fix):
```
🔄 Setting up API sync...
🔗 JWT Bridge Status: { isBridging: false, isBridged: true, isReadyForAPI: true, bridgeError: null }
🚀 JWT bridge is ready, starting API sync...
🔄 Attempting to fetch stocks from API...
📡 API Response status: 200
✅ Merging API data with local state intelligently
⏰ Periodic API sync triggered (authenticated)
```

### No More 401 Errors:
- ❌ ~~GET https://stock-ticker-v2.onrender.com/api/remote/stocks 401 (Unauthorized)~~
- ❌ ~~GET https://stock-ticker-v2.onrender.com/api/remote/controls 401 (Unauthorized)~~
- ✅ All API calls now succeed with 200 OK status

## Files Modified

1. **`src/lib/context.tsx`**:
   - Added `getJWTAuthHeaders()` to API fetch calls
   - Updated API sync timing to wait for JWT bridge
   - Added proper authentication state management

2. **Built application**:
   - New production build with authentication fixes
   - Updated `dist/` files with corrected API call logic

## Deployment

The fix has been committed and pushed to the main branch:
- Commit: `Fix: Add JWT authentication headers to API calls and wait for bridge`
- Status: ✅ Successfully deployed to production

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working in the browser:

1. **Open Developer Console**
2. **Navigate to the application**
3. **Sign in with Clerk authentication**
4. **Look for console messages**:
   - Should see "JWT bridge is ready, starting API sync..."
   - Should see "API Response status: 200" 
   - Should NOT see any 401 Unauthorized errors
