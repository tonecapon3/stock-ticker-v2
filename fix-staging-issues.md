# Staging Environment Issues Fix

## Issues Identified:

1. **404 on `/remote` route** - SPA routing not working
2. **404 on API endpoints** - API calls failing
3. **Clerk development keys warning** - Using test keys in production
4. **POST instead of GET** - Wrong HTTP methods being used

## Root Causes:

### 1. SPA Routing Issue
The `/remote` route returns 404 because the hosting provider (AWS Amplify) is not properly configured for Single Page Application routing.

**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - amplify.yml has correct SPA redirects

### 2. HTTP Method Issue  
The `fetchStocks()` and `fetchControls()` functions were not explicitly setting the GET method, causing some environments to default to POST.

**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Added explicit `method: 'GET'` to API calls

### 3. API Server Status
The API server `https://stock-ticker-v2.onrender.com` is responding correctly but might be experiencing intermittent issues.

### 4. Clerk Development Keys
Using test keys (`pk_test_`, `sk_test_`) in staging environment triggers warnings.

## Applied Fixes:

### âœ… Fixed API Method Calls
```javascript
// OLD (causing POST requests)
const response = await apiCall('/stocks');

// NEW (explicit GET)  
const response = await apiCall('/stocks', { method: 'GET' });
```

### âœ… SPA Routing Configuration
- `public/_redirects`: `/* /index.html 200`
- `amplify.yml`: SPA redirect rules configured
- Should handle `/remote` route properly

### ðŸ”„ Next Steps for Full Fix:

1. **Update Clerk to Production Keys** (for staging):
   ```bash
   # In AWS Amplify environment variables:
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...  # Production key
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...            # Production key
   ```

2. **Verify API Server Health**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET https://stock-ticker-v2.onrender.com/api/remote/stocks
   # Should return: {"error":"Access token required",...}
   ```

3. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   - Access `/remote` route
   - Should show stable login form
   - Login with: admin / AdminSecure2025!@
   - Should load control panel

## Expected Results After Fix:

âœ… `/remote` route loads without 404  
âœ… Login form appears stable (no blinking)  
âœ… API calls use GET method correctly  
âœ… Authentication works properly  
âœ… Remote control panel loads after login  

## Verification Commands:

```bash
# Test SPA routing
curl -I https://staging.dv565hju499c6.amplifyapp.com/remote/

# Test API server
curl -X GET https://stock-ticker-v2.onrender.com/api/remote/stocks

# Check build output
npm run build:production
```

The main fixes (API method calls) have been applied and committed.
