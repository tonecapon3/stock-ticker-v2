# API Server Status Resolution Summary

## Issue Description
- API server was offline and returning 401 Unauthorized errors
- Health checks were failing on Render deployment platform
- Remote controls API endpoints were inaccessible

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue had multiple components:

1. **Wrong Server Selection**: The production starter script was selecting `server-hybrid-fixed.cjs` instead of `server.js`
2. **Missing Health Endpoint**: The selected server file was missing the `/status/health` endpoint required by Render
3. **Authentication Configuration**: JWT authentication was properly configured but client needed updated credentials

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Server Health Endpoints
- Added missing `/status/health` endpoint to `server-hybrid-fixed.cjs` for Render health check compatibility
- Maintained existing `/health` endpoint for backwards compatibility
- Health endpoint now returns proper JSON response with authentication status

### 2. Authentication System
- Confirmed JWT authentication is working correctly with updated password `AdminSecure2025!@`
- Verified hybrid authentication system (JWT + Clerk) is operational
- Updated client-side JWT bridge credentials in previous session

### 3. API Functionality
- All API endpoints are operational:
  - `/health` - Basic health check
  - `/status/health` - Render-compatible health check  
  - `/api/remote/auth` - JWT authentication endpoint
  - `/api/remote/controls` - Remote controls API (requires auth)
  - `/api/remote/stocks` - Stock data API (requires auth)

## Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED

### API Server Status
- **Health Check**: ✅ PASSING (`/health` and `/status/health`)
- **Authentication**: ✅ WORKING (JWT with `AdminSecure2025!@`)
- **Remote Controls**: ✅ ACCESSIBLE (with proper JWT token)
- **Stock Data**: ✅ ACCESSIBLE (with proper JWT token)

### Test Results
```bash
# Health Check
$ curl https://stock-ticker-v2.onrender.com/health
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-09-24T21:56:28.562Z","authentication":{"jwt":true,"clerk":true}}

# Render Health Check
$ curl https://stock-ticker-v2.onrender.com/status/health
{"success":true,"health":"healthy","checks":{"api":"ok","responseTime":0,"timestamp":"2025-09-24T21:56:38.406Z","version":"1.0.0-hybrid","server":"stock-ticker-backend-hybrid"},"authentication":{"jwt":true,"clerk":true}}

# Authentication
$ curl -X POST https://stock-ticker-v2.onrender.com/api/remote/auth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"AdminSecure2025!@"}'
{"success":true,"token":"eyJ...","user":{"id":1,"username":"admin","role":"admin"},"authMethod":"jwt"}

# API Access
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://stock-ticker-v2.onrender.com/api/remote/controls
{"success":true,"controls":{"isPaused":false,"updateIntervalMs":1000,"selectedCurrency":"USD","lastUpdated":"2025-09-24T21:55:33.358Z","isEmergencyStopped":false},"authMethod":"jwt"}
```

## Files Modified
- `server-hybrid-fixed.cjs` - Added `/status/health` endpoint for Render compatibility

## Next Steps
- Monitor server stability on Render platform
- Verify client application connects successfully with updated credentials  
- Consider updating environment variables on Render if additional configuration needed

## Resolution Date
September 24, 2025 - 21:57 UTC
