# üîç How to Find Your AWS API Server URL

## Method 1: AWS Console (Recommended - No CLI needed)

### Option A: API Gateway Console
1. **Login to AWS Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/
2. **Go to API Gateway**: Search for "API Gateway" in the services
3. **Find your API**:
   - Look for REST APIs or HTTP APIs
   - Your API might be named something like "stock-ticker-api" or similar
4. **Get the URL**:
   - Click on your API name
   - Look for "Invoke URL" or "API endpoint"
   - Copy the full URL (e.g., `https://abc123def.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod`)

### Option B: AWS Amplify Console
1. **Go to Amplify**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
2. **Find your backend**:
   - Look for backend environments or API services
   - Your API URL might be listed in the environment details
3. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - If you deployed through Amplify, the API URL might be in environment variables

### Option C: Lambda Console
1. **Go to Lambda**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/
2. **Find your functions**: Look for functions related to your stock ticker
3. **Check triggers**: Functions with API Gateway triggers will show the API URL

### Option D: CloudFormation Console
1. **Go to CloudFormation**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/
2. **Find your stack**: Look for stacks related to your deployment
3. **Check Outputs tab**: The API URL is often in the stack outputs

## Method 2: Using AWS CLI (if available)

### Install AWS CLI
```bash
# macOS
brew install awscli

# Alternative for macOS
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
```

### Configure AWS CLI
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID
# Enter your AWS Secret Access Key  
# Enter your default region (e.g., us-east-1)
# Enter output format (json)
```

### Find API URLs
```bash
# Run our discovery script
./scripts/find-aws-api-url.sh

# Or manually:
# List API Gateway REST APIs
aws apigateway get-rest-apis

# List API Gateway HTTP APIs
aws apigatewayv2 get-apis

# List Amplify apps
aws amplify list-apps
```

## Method 3: Common AWS API URL Patterns

AWS API URLs typically follow these patterns:

### API Gateway REST API:
```
https://{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage}
```
**Example**: `https://abc123def.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod`

### API Gateway HTTP API:
```
https://{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/
```
**Example**: `https://xyz789abc.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`

### Lambda Function URL:
```
https://{url-id}.lambda-url.{region}.on.aws/
```
**Example**: `https://abcd1234-efgh-5678-ijkl-9012mnop3456.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws`

## Method 4: Check Your Deployment Logs

If you deployed recently, check your deployment logs for:
- "API Gateway endpoint created"
- "Invoke URL"
- "API endpoint"
- Any URLs that look like the patterns above

## Method 5: Network Tab Method

1. **Open your current deployment** (if working partially)
2. **Open browser Developer Tools** (F12)
3. **Go to Network tab**
4. **Try to use a feature** that makes API calls
5. **Look for failed requests** - the URL will show where it's trying to connect

## üîß Once You Find Your API URL

### Step 1: Test the URL
Open your browser and try to access:
```
https://your-api-url.com/api/remote/status/health
```

### Step 2: Update Your Environment
Run our update script:
```bash
./scripts/update-api-url.sh https://your-api-url.com
```

### Step 3: Manual Update (if script doesn't work)
Edit `.env.production`:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-url.com
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Unable to find API"
- **Check different AWS regions** - your API might be in a different region
- **Look in all AWS services** - Lambda, API Gateway, Amplify, etc.
- **Check if deployment completed** - the API might still be deploying

### Issue: "Access denied in AWS Console"
- **Check your AWS permissions** - you need read access to API Gateway, Lambda, etc.
- **Ask whoever deployed it** - they should have the URL information

### Issue: "API URL doesn't work"
- **Check HTTPS vs HTTP** - AWS typically uses HTTPS
- **Verify the path** - make sure `/api/remote` is correct
- **Check if API server is running** - it might be stopped or crashed

### Issue: "Multiple APIs found"
- **Look for naming patterns** - APIs related to "stock", "ticker", etc.
- **Check creation dates** - newer APIs are probably the ones you want
- **Test each URL** - try accessing the health endpoint

## üìã Quick Reference

### What you're looking for:
- URL starting with `https://`
- Contains `amazonaws.com` or your custom domain
- Responds to `/api/remote/stocks` or `/api/remote/status/health`
- Created around the time you deployed your backend

### Common locations:
1. API Gateway ‚Üí Your API ‚Üí Stages ‚Üí Invoke URL
2. Lambda ‚Üí Your function ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Function URL
3. Amplify ‚Üí Your app ‚Üí Backend environments
4. CloudFormation ‚Üí Your stack ‚Üí Outputs

### Test commands:
```bash
# Test if URL is working
curl -X POST https://your-api-url/api/remote/status/health

# Test CORS
curl -H "Origin: https://your-frontend-domain.com" \
     -X OPTIONS \
     https://your-api-url/api/remote/stocks
```
